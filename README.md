## What's This About?

So basically I made this portfolio site using HTML, CSS (Tailwind) and JavaScript. No React or any framework, just plain vanilla JS because I wanted to understand the basics properly first. The site has my projects, a blog section where I write about tech stuff, and yeah it looks pretty decent I think.

## Main Features

**Portfolio Section:**
- Shows all my projects with descriptions
- Has an about me section
- Contact info and social links
- Animations using AOS library (looks cool ngl)

**Blog:**
- I write about my coding journey and what I'm learning
- Supports code snippets with syntax highlighting
- All content renders client-side using JavaScript


## My Projects

### 1. Portfolio Website
The website you're looking at! Built from scratch using:
- HTML5 for structure
- Tailwind CSS for styling (used CDN, no npm needed)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- Particles.js for background effects
- AOS for scroll animations

It's fully responsive and works on mobile too. The blog section dynamically renders posts without any page reload which is pretty cool.

### 2. Weather App 🌦️
A real-time weather application that shows current weather and forecasts.

**Features:**
- Gets your location automatically
- Shows temperature, humidity, wind speed etc.
- Uses OpenWeatherMap API
- Clean UI with weather icons

**Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenWeather API

### 3. AI Resume Analyzer 📄
This one was a bit challenging but fun! It's an AI-powered tool that analyzes resumes.

**What it does:**
- Uploads PDF/Word resumes
- Extracts text using NLP
- Analyzes skills and experience
- Gives suggestions for improvement
- Shows skill gap analysis

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- NLP libraries for text processing

### 4. Mess Manager System 🍽️
Made this for our college mess management. Helps manage daily meals, attendance, and monthly bills.

**Features:**
- Monthly bill calculation
- Generate monthly reports

**Tech Stack:**
- HTML, CSS, 
- JavaScript(ES Modules)
- Firebase(Auth + Firestore)

**Live:** https://mess-maneger.onrender.com/

**Why I built this:** Our hostel mess had issues with manual attendance and billing, so I thought why not make something useful. Still working on adding more features like meal feedback system.




## How to Run

It's super simple:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/JyotirmoyLaha/j.portfolio.git

# Go to the folder
cd j.portfolio

# Just open index.html in your browser
# That's it! No npm install, no build process, nothing.
```

You can also just download the ZIP file and open index.html directly. Works right away.

## What I'm Learning

- JavaScript fundamentals (closures, promises, async/await)
- API integration and handling responses
- Making responsive designs that actually work
- Python for backend stuff
- Data structures (currently doing trees and graphs)
- Trying to understand how frameworks work under the hood

## Future Plans

**New Projects:**
- [ ] Working on some AI/ML stuff (just started learning)
- [ ] Want to build a chatbot
- [ ] Maybe a e-commerce site clone for practice
- [ ] Some DSA visualizations using JavaScript

## Why I Built This

Honestly, I wanted to learn web development properly and the best way is to build real projects. Started with simple HTML pages and kept adding features. Made mistakes, learned from them, and kept improving.
